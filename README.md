# Ecommerce Back End

## Description
This application is an Ecommerce Website but only goes through the back end portion. With this being said, this uses Express.js for the server, MySQL for the database, and Sequelize so that SQL can run the models and queries. In the mySQL database, there is a table that has rows called products, categories, tags, and product tags. The API routes help the user request and update anything information from the database.
